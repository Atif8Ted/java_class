Q-1)
                      
                      import javax.servlet.http.*;
                      public class SessionListener implements HttpSessionListener
                       {
line1--                   public void sessionCreated() {            
                          System.out.println(" Session Created: ");
                           }
line 2--              public void sessionDestroyed() {
                         System.out.println(" Session Destroyed:");
                            }
                    }

which one in wrong(check box):
(1) line one :method does not contain correct argument
(2) line two: method does not contain correct argument
(3) import statement doesnot implement HttpSessionListener interface
(4) all method of HttpSessionListener should not implement in this code

ANS:
according to me option 1 and 2 both wrong
because correct syntex is:
public class SessionListener implements HttpSessionListener
{
  public void sessionCreated(HttpSessionEvent event) {
    System.out.println(" Session Created: ");
  }
  public void sessionDestroyed(HttpSessionEvent event) {
     System.out.println(" Session Destroyed:");
  }
}
